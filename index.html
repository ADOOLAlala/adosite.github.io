                <h2>Early Life and Career Beginnings</h2>
                <p>
                    Ado (born October 24, 2002) is a Japanese singer and songwriter who gained prominence with her
                    distinctive voice and impactful music.<br> From a young age, Ado was captivated by music, particularly
                    Vocaloid songs. In her early teens, she became interested in the culture of <br>"utaite"—singers who
                    cover songs and share them online without revealing their identities. This fascination led her to
                    start her own journey<br> as a singer.</p>
                <p>On January 10, 2017, at the age of 14, Ado began her musical career by uploading a cover of the
                    Vocaloid song "Kimi no Taion" to the Japanese <br>video-sharing platform Niconico. This marked the
                    beginning of her presence in the online music community.</p>

                <h2>Breakthrough with "Usseewa"</h2>
                <p>
                    Ado's major breakthrough came in 2020 when she released her debut single, "Usseewa," at the age of
                    17. The song quickly gained massive<br> popularity, resonating with a wide audience for its bold lyrics
                    and powerful delivery. "Usseewa" topped several charts, including the Billboard<br> Japan Hot 100 and
                    the Oricon Digital Singles Chart. It also reached 100 million plays on Billboard Japan within 17
                    weeks, making it one of<br> the fastest songs to achieve this milestone and establishing Ado as the
                    youngest solo artist to do so.</p>

                <h2>Artistic Style and Persona</h2>
                <p>
                    Ado is known for maintaining a sense of mystery by not revealing her face publicly, a practice
                    common among "utaite" artists. Her music often<br> features a blend of rock, pop, and Vocaloid-inspired
                    elements, characterized by her dynamic vocal performances and emotionally charged delivery.</p>

                <h2>Recent Activities</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                    As of February 2025, Ado continues to be an influential figure in the Japanese music scene. She has
                    released multiple singles and albums, collaborated<br> with various artists, and her music videos have
                    garnered significant attention online. Her commitment to her unique artistic vision and her ability
                    to<br> connect with listeners have solidified her status as a prominent artist in contemporary Japanese
                    music.</p>
