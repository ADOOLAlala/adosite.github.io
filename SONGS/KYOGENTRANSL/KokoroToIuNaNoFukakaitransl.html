                    <p>The sound of you blinking,<br>
                        And even the sound of you looking away,<br>
                        Even though I can distinguish them so easily...</p>
                        
                        <p>Sometimes, I wonder what to call this disease,<br>
                        Though I don't have hopes for<br>
                        This heart no one can understand...</p>
                        
                        <p>There's not a single hint of madness<br>
                        In the correctly recorded zig-zags<br>
                        So surely, there's no meaning other than that</p>
                        
                        <p>"Therefore, with what face should I laugh?"<br>
                        The things I won't write in the charts<br>
                        Have no credibility to be believed in</p>
                        
                        <p>And that's all that matters</p>
                        
                        <p>Sending out heartbeats<br>
                        Sending out heartbeats</p>
                        
                        <p>And just with that,</p>
                        
                        <p>It's something ambiguous, it's something invisible<br>
                        And finding the best cure for it is impossible</p>
                        
                        <p>Please,<br>
                        How should I adjunct my feelings properly?<br>
                        How should I judge my state of mind properly?<br>
                        An ambiguity that's unable to be proven<br>
                        Spits out errors and pulsates</p>
                        
                        <p>I couldn't care less about peace and comfort<br>
                        I don't even care if I live full of regrets,<br>
                        So what is the reason for this disease that waters my eyes?</p>
                        
                        <p>A report that knocks on the door of eternity and silence,<br>
                        I wonder when will I stop forgetting about it?</p>
                        
                        <p>With fingers connecting tomorrow<br>
                        I end up counting the things I lost along the way<br>
                        Amidst the emptiness</p>

                        <p>The truth is,</p>
                        
                        <p>If you were able to go berserk and touch me,<br>
                        The peeking open gap in my chest would be filled</p>
                        
                        <p>Is this the real me?</p>
                        
                        <p>Ending up putting a scalpel to my face<br>
                        Ending up thinking of love as some remedy<br>
                        In an operating table, unable to do an autopsy,<br>
                        I guess I'll never know the answer then...</p>
                        
                        <p>You can't prove everything with simple formulas<br>
                        About this enigma called heart, So please,<br>
                        Watch as I'm unable to be honest,</p>
                        
                        <p>And see through me.</p>
