                    <p>A sky blue apartment, I pass through the door I’ve grown used to seeing<br>  
                        The end of spring and a small snooze</p>  
                        
                        <p>The remaining aspirations I wrote down and the fickle rain – I hate them both<br>  
                        The sleeves of a drowned shirt, I pretend to not see</p>  
                        
                        <p>To say “what’s happened” on ordinary days<br>  
                        It would be so easy to just say “I already hate this”<br>  
                        Suddenly thinking of the future while waiting for the bus<br>  
                        To say “what’s happened” on zero-degree days<br>  
                        It would be so easy to just say “It’s fine as it is”<br>  
                        The inside of my heart has become lonely</p>  
                        
                        <p>Hey, the fireworks have been set alight, hey, the fireworks have been set alight<br>  
                        The remains of my youth and my helpless thoughts<br>  
                        The chill of dawn and my shifting heart<br>  
                        Seem like they’ll be left to the ending credits</p>  
                        
                        <p>The light of a stranger’s life<br>  
                        Flows and sways away from the train window on the way back home<br>  
                        The story of a stranger’s life<br>  
                        I’m still unable to love the unchanging days</p>  
                        
                        <p>To say “what’s happened” on ordinary days<br>  
                        It would be so easy to just say “I already hate this”<br>  
                        Suddenly thinking of the future while waiting for the bus<br>

                        It would be so easy to just say “It’s fine as it is”<br>  
                        The inside of my heart has become lonely</p>

                        The remains of my youth and my helpless thoughts<br>  
                        The chill of dawn and my shifting heart<br>  
                        Seem like they’ll be left to the ending credits</p>

                        The chill of dawn and my shifting heart<br>  
                        Seem like they’ll be left to the end roll</p>  
                        
                        <p>It seems as if it is nowhere<br>  
                        It seems as if it is nowhere<br>  
                        The reflected light soaks everything in blue<br>  
                        It seems as if it is nowhere<br>  
                        It seems as if it is nowhere<br>  
                        The monotone parade disappears almost immediately<br>  
                        On the last night</p>
